I want a news feed that gives me relevant news for new ai models that are groundbreaking in object detection, classification, segmentation LLM releases.  
I'd like to navigate to the page every day.  
Ideally if no news has happened there won't be any articles so i don't have to sift through articles I don't care about.

It should publish to github pages.  Every day at 8am eastern the page should be updated.
I'd like the update job to be hosted on a free service.
